## One-Liner

Glowing humanoid robots beat the shit out of each other to music. The arena is alive. Hits feel like fireworks.

## The Vision

### The Fighters

**Grounded futurism.** Not fantasy mechs, not cartoon robots. The logical endpoint of what Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas, and Figure are building right now - but realized, beautiful, and luminous.

- **Humanoid proportions** - human-sized, human-shaped, dancer/athlete build
- **Grace AND power** - they move like martial artists, not action figures
- **Inner glow** - light emits from within; they're alive with energy
- **Aspirational machines** - what robots want to become

They're almost real. That's what makes it compelling.

### The Deaths

**Fireworks, not gore.**

When a fighter dies, they don't crumple - they *shatter*. Like light-emitting glass breaking into a thousand glowing fragments. A spectacular burst. A celebration of the moment.

No blood. No violence-for-violence's-sake. Just beautiful destruction.

### The Arena

**A living colosseum.**

The arena isn't just a space - it's a character. It breathes with the music:

- **Bass/beat** → walls pulse inward (speaker cone effect)
- **Sweeping sounds** → blade/wave hazards sweep across
- **Vocals** → energy amplitude, fire, light intensity
- **Everything reacts** → the whole world is an instrument

Clean, futuristic, geometric. Cubes and modular tech. Crisp warning telegraphs before hazards hit.

### The Audience

**They're next.**

The arena is surrounded by glass walls - a skyscraper facade, a colosseum. Behind the glass: rows of dim humanoid silhouettes. Waiting. Watching. *Dancing to the beat.*

When a fighter dies:
1. One silhouette in the crowd lights up gold
2. They step through the glass
3. They're the new fighter

The audience isn't passive. They're participants waiting for their turn. Fans and gladiators.

### The Broadcast (Future)

**Illegal. Underground. A dirty digital pipe.**

You're not supposed to be watching this. The signal is bootleg, smuggled, illicit. Adds grit and stakes to the spectacle.

Score might be shown through diegetic elements - arena lights, fighter glow intensity - rather than floating numbers. The world tells you who's winning.

## 2D vs 3D: Same Soul, Different Fidelity

### The Commitment

**Ship 2D v1 first. Prove the concept. Find the audience. Learn from the full loop.**

No "writing a novel that never sees light." We complete build→release→learn before scaling up.

### 2D v1 (Current Build)

The *approximation* that stands on its own:

- Fighters as glowing silhouettes with inner light (graceful humanoid shapes)
- Particle bursts on hit, glass-shard effects on death
- Geometric arena with emissive edges
- Beat-reactive screen effects, hazard pulses
- Dim audience silhouettes along edges, bobbing to beat
- New fighter lights up and enters on death

Should feel *intentional*, not compromised. "This is cool AND imagine it in full 3D."

### 3D v2 (Future - Unreal)

The *realization*:

- Full humanoid robot models, motion-captured fluidity
- Internal emissive materials, dynamic lighting
- Glass fracture physics on death
- Full stadium of dancing spectators behind glass
- Camera beats on new fighter stepping through
- Beat-reactive world geometry, not just effects

Same soul. Just fully realized.

## Reference Points

**Visual:**
- Tesla Optimus / Boston Dynamics Atlas (humanoid robot design)
- Tron Legacy (glow aesthetic, digital world)
- Geometry Wars (particle spectacle, clean geometry)
- Inside/Limbo (silhouette power in 2D)

**Feel:**
- What GTA 1 was to GTA 3
- What Fallout 1 was to Fallout 3
- The 2D version implies the 3D version; the 3D version realizes it without pivoting

**Vibe:**
- Clean, futuristic, not cute
- Spectacular violence without gore
- Music as co-star, not background
- Underground, illicit, electric

## Design Pillars

1. **Music is the heartbeat** - Everything reacts. The world exists inside the song.
2. **Hits feel like fireworks** - Every impact is spectacular. Deaths are celebrations.
3. **Grounded futurism** - Almost-real robots, not fantasy. Aspirational machines.
4. **Ship to learn** - 2D v1 completes the loop. 3D v2 only if earned.
5. **Same soul throughout** - No pivots between versions. Fidelity scales, vision doesn't.

*"The simple version is cool in and of itself, and it begs for the fuller version. The full visual version feels like a realization rather than a direction change."*
